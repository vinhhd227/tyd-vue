      Aerial data intelligence at your fingertips. Anytime. Anywhere.

      Our vision is to fully automate data acquisition processes and to become
      the global leader in AI-powered aerial real-time surveillance. To achieve
      this, the “Apple-Approach” is the only way to go: a combination of great
      software with world leading hardware. We work on bringing together
      software and hardware technologies to provide an end-to-end platform for
      acquiring data, which will serve as the basis for sustainable
      decisions.<br />To build the next generation products, we are investing
      heavily in software. That includes artificial intelligence, which will
      enhance our ability to provide situational awareness to our operators;
      edge computing, which facilitates real-time data processing onboard our
      UAS; and new elements in our mission planning software, which allows
      operators to orchestrate complex operations with the click of a button.
