          The visionary and initiator Florian Seibel formed the core team around
          him in 2011. Florian Seibel met Dr. Michael Kriegel during their PhD
          work at the Chair of Flight Systems Dynamics at the University of the
          German Armed Forces in Munich. Tobias Kloss and Armin Busse joined
          shortly after. The team founded Quantum-Systems GmbH in January 2015.
          Since then, the turnover and the number of employees grew continuously
          with triple-digit percentage growth year over year. Three of the four
          founders hold active positions within Quantum-Systems GmbH.

                  Florian is the visionary initiator and founding CEO of Quantum
                  Systems. He was an officer in the German Armed Forces from
                  1999 to 2016 and graduated as an aerospace engineer at the
                  University of Munich.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After his employment as a helicopter pilot in Germany and
                  abroad, he joined the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at the
                  University of Munich as a research assistant in 2010 working
                  on his PhD. His main fields of activity included the
                  development and operation of different carrier platforms based
                  on multi-copters and fixed-wing UAVs. He never finished his
                  PhD but decided to found Quantum-Systems instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Florian is a passionate glider pilot, flight instructor,
                  paraglider, and helicopter pilot. In his spare time, he enjoys
                  long walks and runs with his dog.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Florian is the driving force behind Quantum-Systems, who loves
                  to challenge his engineers daily, and is focusing on
                  technology, products and strategy in his role. His vision is
                  to transform Quantum-Systems into a world leader in AI-powered
                  aerial intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the Russian invasion in Ukraine he made the decision to
                  support the Ukrainian Armed Forces in an “whatever it takes”
                  approach. Florian strongly believes in western democratic
                  principles and is ready to defend them.
